## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).

## Contributing

This repository is the starter code for _all_ Udacity students. Therefore, we most likely will not accept pull requests.

# How to play the game

Pick out cards on the table to see if the same symbol gets fliped over.

If they Match they will stay open.

Tf they don't the card will flip back over.  

When all the cards are fliped over the game will end.

## End of Game

When the game ends a modal will appear.

This will tell you your star rating, moves made, and how much time it took you to complete the game.

## Star Rating 

Less then 10 moves gives you 3 stars.

10 to 18 moves gives you 2 stars.

19 to 25 moves gives you 1 star.

Over 26 moves will give you 1 star.
